Intro:
use To make Elements Dynamic of Html and Css
use Script tag to include Javascript in the Html Document

How javascript Works :
javascript made ne netscape -> Moxxilla

Name of browser  Javascript Engine Name
Mozilla          Spider Monkey
Chrome           v8
Edge             Chakra

script tag : code kahise fetch hoke run hota hai
script get loaded from network, cashe , Worker , passed to a byte steam decoder
these byte SD decodes Byte into tokens . Tokens sent to parser
Parser generates Nodes based on tokens ,  and creates Abstract Syntax tree
these process called as Interpreter 
javascript is Dynamically type k=language : that means data values Change Repetedly
data type Change reatedly so it takes time
to solve this error js used Optimized machine cope

OMC :let any function return some data type then js assumes that function return same value as Previous

# Document Object Model (DOM) :
Document -> Root Elemet(html) -> Element(head)(child of html tag) ->Element(Title)(child of head tag)

#Ways to addd Javascript in Web Pages :
1)Js always add after rendering of the element 
2)as html follows line by line Execution
3)First  way Always Write js Below of the webpages
4)Second way is that using DomContentLoaded
5)Third  way use Attribute defer (script js loaded only when html css loaded)
Use for External Javascript only
Takes place as line by line Execution
Takes Time
when One js Tag executes others are blocked
6)Fourth way using async Tag
One time Execution
All js Files loads when DOM loading as the same time
All js Files Executes at One Time
All unblocked at the same Time

Async : use when  no scripts are blocked or all working independently & order not matters
Defer : Dom Dependent (Tag dependend on some Tag for execution )
